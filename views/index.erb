<h2>Rules of Mastermind</h2>
<p>
The game consists of a codemaker and a codebreaker.</br>
There are six types of code pegs: [A] [B] [C] [D] [E] [F]</br>
There are two types of key pegs: [W] [Z]</br>

The codemaker will choose a hidden pattern of any combination of four code pegs.</br>
Duplicates can be included.</br>
For example, the codemaker might choose: [C] [A] [C] [F]</br>

The codebreaker has 12 attempts to correctly guess the hidden pattern.</br> 
After each guess,the codemaker will use the key pegs to give hints.</br>
Each [W] peg shown signifies a correct code peg in the right position.</br>
Each [Z] peg shown signifies a correct code peg, but in the wrong position.</br>

The codemaker receives one point for each attempt made by the codebreaker.</br>
